This is a simple iOS and Android app built to make refilling Charlie Cards easier for the MBTA in the Boston area. The MBTA Charlie Cards come with multiple major drawbacks in their payment system:

1. Not every station has a location nearby to refill empty cards. This may mean a walk of up to 2 miles to reach the next nearest station with a refilling station.
2. Refilling Charlie cards online is difficult. The UI is designed poorly and is tough to use on mobile views, and can take up to 24 hours to actually add money to your card.

Issues such as the 24 hour wait time still persist, but the app allows for a more convenient way to take advantage of the online resources such that you will never be caught empty at a bus stop or train station.
